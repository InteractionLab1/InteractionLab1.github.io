      Meet Kai! Kai is a robot that lives in the Interaction Lab at USC. Kai’s favorite thing to do is play tic-tac-toe with people. The two of you will now play a few games of tic-tac-toe together. You will make a move first, and then Kai will make a move after you. This will continue until one of you wins or the board is full (a tie or “cat’s game”). After each game of tic-tac-toe, you will see and hear from Kai, and then we will ask you to answer a few questions about your experience. Let’s get started!
